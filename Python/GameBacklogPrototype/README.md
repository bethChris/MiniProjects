# Game Backlog Prototype

## Overview
This mini project will serve as a prototype for an idea i've had for a gaming backlog tracker. I want to use Flask to host the API and learn how to use Playwright more throughouly. (Instead of just Postman)

## Outline
- Small Flask application that hosts a small UI
- Connect to game API (public use)
- Utilize Playwright to test links, titles, and (maybe) API content
- Test it on web and mobile (maybe utilize Playwright emulation feature)
